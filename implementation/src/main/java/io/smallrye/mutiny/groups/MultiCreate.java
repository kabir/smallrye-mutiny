     * Creates a {@link Multi} from a <em>resource</em>, generated by a supplier function called for each individual
     * {@link Subscriber}, while streaming the items from a {@link Publisher Publisher/Multi} created from the resource.
     * <p>
     * This method gets a <em>resource</em> and creates a {@link Publisher} from this resource (by calling the
     * {@code streamSupplier} function). The subscriber receives the items from this {@link Publisher}. When the stream
     * completes, fails or when the subscriber cancels the subscription, a finalizer is called to <em>close</em> the
     * resource. This cleanup process can be either synchronous and asynchronous, as well as distinct for each type of
     * event.
     *
     * This method can be seen as a reactive version of the "try/finally" construct.
     *
     * @param resourceSupplier a supplier called for each subscriber to generate the resource, must not be {@code null}.
     * @param streamSupplier a function returning the stream for the given resource instance, must not be {@code null}.
     * @param <R> the type of the resource.
     * @param <I> the type of items emitted by the stream produced by the {@code streamSupplier}.
     * @return an object to configure the <em>finalizers</em>.
